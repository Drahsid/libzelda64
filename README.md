# libzelda64
Poe was taking too long with [z64poevl](https://github.com/CrookedPoe/z64ovl/) and we kept missing each other when we agreed to work on it.

## What is this?
Imagine [z64ovl](https://github.com/CrookedPoe/z64ovl/) and [zeldaret/oot](https://github.com/zeldaret/oot) having a baby. This lets you compile code in the context of the zelda64 games (particularly oot 1.0); generally used for actor overlays.

### Why?
I wanted to get the new z64 puppet written, and felt like we should sync up with Decomp's structure and function names, since it will be _the way_.
